# Workout Tracker

Let's try using Vue 3, Capacitor, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase as a dev stack!

## Project setup

1. First, create a new Supabase project and database. You can use the following SQL to create the tables and columns:

```
create table
  public.workouts (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    workoutName character varying null,
    workoutType character varying null,
    exercises json null,
    constraint workouts_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

```

2. Create a new Supabase API key and add it to the `.env` file in the root of the project. The `.env` file should look like this:

```
VUE_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co
VUE_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-api-key>
```

3. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

4. Now, you can run in development mode or build for production. See below for more details.

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

## Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

## Build for Android (with Capacitor) and run emulator

Note: You should have Android SDK and an emulator installed on your machine. Read more https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android `<br>`
The output APK can be found after this step in this path: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug`

```
yarn build
yarn cap add android
yarn cap sync
yarn cap run android
```

## Lints and fixes files

```
yarn lint
```

## Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
